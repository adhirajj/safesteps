## Project Idea

"Walking across campus at night shouldn't be a source of anxiety. SafeStep transforms how students navigate campus by mapping all HELP phones and providing real-time safety features. With live location sharing, direct connection to campus security, and smart navigation to guide you along well-lit paths, SafeStep puts comprehensive safety tools right in your pocket. We're not just updating the HELP phone system – we're creating a dynamic safety companion that gives both students and campus security the modern tools they need to ensure everyone gets home safely."
